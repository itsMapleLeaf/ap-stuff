# Object classes from AP that represent different types of options that you can create
from Options import OptionSet

# These helper methods allow you to determine if an option has been set, or what its value is, for any player in the multiworld

# NOTE: At the time that options are created, Manual has no concept of the multiworld or its own world. 
#       Options are defined before the world is even created.
#
# Example of creating your own option:
#
#   class MakeThePlayerOP(Toggle):
#       """Should the player be overpowered? Probably not, but you can choose for this to do... something!"""
#       display_name = "Make me OP"
#
#   options["make_op"] = MakeThePlayerOP
#
#
# Then, to see if the option is set, you can call is_option_enabled or get_option_value.

# To add an option, use the before_options_defined hook below and something like this:
#   options["total_characters_to_win_with"] = TotalCharactersToWinWith
#
class Victims(OptionSet):
    """Which players are being linklinked?  If left empty, all of them!"""
    display_name = "LinkLink Players"

    @classmethod
    def get_option_name(cls, value) -> str:
        if value == []:
            return "Everybody"
        return ", ".join(sorted(value))

def before_options_defined(options: dict) -> dict:
